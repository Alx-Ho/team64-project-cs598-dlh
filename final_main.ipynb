    "Predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is challenging due to the complex nature of biological systems and the vast number of possible drug and food combinations. The human body's response to these interactions can vary significantly, making accurate predictions difficult. A major hurdle is the lack of comprehensive data on many drugs and food constituents, including their effects on the body and their metabolic pathways. Moreover, the mechanisms through which DDIs occur are diverse, adding another layer of complexity to prediction efforts. The constant development of new drugs and the updating of existing drug information necessitate continuous revisions of prediction models and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper presents a computational framework named DeepDDI [1], designed to predict drug–drug interactions (DDIs) using only the structural information of the drug constituent pairs as inputs. DeepDDI employs a deep neural network (DNN) optimized to accurately predict 86 DDI types, generating predictions as human-readable sentences with a mean accuracy of 92.4% using the DrugBank gold standard DDI dataset. The input structural information is provided in the Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) format, which describes the chemical compound's structure. This framework aims to enhance the understanding of DDIs and DFIs, providing critical information for drug prescription and dietary suggestions during medication.\n"

    "The proposed model works on SMILES text representations for molecules, and is thus very memory efficient and accessible computational-wise for reproducibility. However, the original paper's repository https://bitbucket.org/kaistsystemsbiology/deepddi/src/master/ did not contain the training scripts for their deep learning algorithm nor the model definition. The ChemicalX library https://github.com/AstraZeneca/chemicalx contains an implemenation of the model as described in the original paper, but it is not maintained so it proved difficult to get the environment set up so that it would work in Google Colab's environment. Therefore, we implemented the model without the use of the ChemicalX library, and instead defined a new PyTorch model class using the ChemicalX implemenation as a reference.\n",

Due to compute credit limits with Google Colab, we limited training to 5 epochs and the dataset to 8,192 samples for training, 2,048 for validation, and 2,048 for hold-out testing."

Here, we use the direct molecular fingerprint, which is a binary encoding of length 2048. For the draft, we reduce the complexity of the model compared to the paper (8 layers --> 3 layers), and we also limit the training by reducing the dataset size as well as the number of training epochs (100 to 5). Furthermore, we only predict a single DDI type, so the output is a single probability of interaction, whereas the original paper defines an output of 86 probabilities for each tested DDI type."

    "The paper was fairly difficult to reproduce without the refrence to ChemicalX [2]. The amount of compute given the dataset size also made it difficult to reproduce at the same scale. The original paper [1] does include a link to their repository containing \"source code,\" however it does not contain any code for training the models nor does it contain any model weights. Moreover, the dataset was fairly intensive for preprocessing, and the paper does not provide a clean version of their data for immediate use. That being said, the model itself is very simple being a standard feed-forward network, so model implementation was straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings and takeaways from the study still hold true in that predicting unseen drug-drug interactions is possible using molecular fingerprints based on structural similarity.\n",
